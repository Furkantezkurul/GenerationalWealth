            <p>Do you have $100?</p>
            <p>If yes, you can follow this tutorial:</p>
            <p>In the last 50 years, the S&P 500 averaged a return of ~10% per year.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the average inflation rate per year was ~4%</p>
            <p>So let's estimate an average return on investment of 5% per year on the S&P 500.</p>
            <p>f you would put your $100 into the S&P 500…</p>

            
            <p>
              
                <span class="year">Then in 20 years</span>
                
            </p>
            <p class="textUnderYear">Your $100 would be worth</p>
            <p>$<span class="amount">265</span></p>

            <p><span class="year">In 40 years</span></p>
            <p>It would be worth</p>
            <p>$<span class="amount">700</span></p>

            <p>How much money would you have on your deathbed?</p>

            <p><span class="year">In 80 years</span></p>
            <p>Your $100 would be worth</p>
            <p>$<span class="amount">4,956</span></p>

            <p>Okay, in your lifetime you can't create generational wealth.</p>
            <p>But how about your grandchildren?</p>

            <p><span class="year">In 150 years</span></p>
            <p>Your money would be worth</p>
            <p>$<span class="amount">150,798</span></p>

            <p><span class="year">In 190 years</span></p>
            <p>Your investment will finally reach</p>
            <p>$<span class="amount">1,061,614</span></p>

            <p>Finally a millionaire <img src="images/money-on-grave.jpg" alt="Money on the grave"></p>

            <p>But why stop there?</p>
            <p><span class="year">In 300 years</span></p>
            <p>Your investment would reach</p>
            <p>$<span class="amount">227,339,613</span></p>

            <p>Enough money to feed 1,894 families for a decade</p>

            <p><span class="year">In 340 years</span></p>
            <p>Your investment would be worth</p>
            <p>$<span class="amount">1,600,890,708</span></p>

            <p>Making you one of the 3,200 Billionaires in the world.</p>

            <p>Well… you are dead for 250+ years until then.</p>

            <p>But what if we wait some more?</p>

            <p><span class="year">In 450 years</span></p>
            <p>You would be richer than Elon Musk (Networth: 225B)</p>
            <p>Your net worth in 450 years: $<span class="amount">342,913,498,804</span></p>

            <p>And just 50 years later (<span class="year">In 500 years</span>)</p>
            <p>You would be richer than the richest man who ever lived (Emperor Musa, estimated Net worth: 400B $)</p>
            <p>Your net worth in 500 years: $<span class="amount">3,932,326,182,722</span></p>
            
            <p>And <span class="year">In 600 years</span></p>
            <p>Your investment would be worth</p>
            <p>$<span class="amount">517,105,839,289,867</span></p>

            <p>That's 517 Trillion</p>
            
            <p>For reference:</p>
            <p>According to a 2023 report, the total amount of money in the world is roughly only $40 trillion in circulation.</p>
